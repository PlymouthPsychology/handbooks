As well as completing the modules that make up your programme, all students in the School participate in a series of tutorials designed to support your academic and professional development. These differ by year of study, and are described briefly below.

It's important to note that most of these activities are not on your timetable and will be arranged by your personal tutor. 

For more on personal tutors, [go here](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/handbooks/personal_tutors.html). To find out who your personal tutor is, check the "Tutor Groups" system on the [School's internal web page](https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/).

## Stage 1

Stage 1 tutorials are delivered as part of a system called Briefings, Practice, and Progress (BPP). It has three components:

Briefings: Weekly Zoom meetings for the whole cohort, usually at 10am on Mondays. These work a bit like school assemblies, and provide information about what's happening on the course and more widely in the School. They also introduce Practice exercises.

Practice: Short exercises designed to help develop your academic skills. Most can be completed online in around 20 minutes. There will usually be one task per week, introduced in the weekly Briefing.

Progress: Meetings with your personal tutor to review your progress and Practice exercises. These will normally take place in your tutor's office in Portland Square, often with small groups of two or three students. You should expect two or three Progress meetings in each semester, by arrangement with your tutor. 

The [programme DLE page](https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38727) contains a link to the online BPP system, and the Zoom link for weekly Briefings (in the "Tutorial information" section).

## Stage 2

Stage 2 students have three group tutorials in each semester, by arrangement with tutors. The schedule is on the [programme DLE page](https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38727), in the "Tutorial information" section. Your tutor may also arrange individual meetings to discuss your progress.

## Stage 4

As in Stage 2, Stage 4 students have group and individual tutorials by arrangement with tutors. In Stage 4 there is a greater emphasis on individual meetings so that we can focus on your progress and achievement in this important stage of your degree.
