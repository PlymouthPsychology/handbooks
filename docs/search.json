    "text": "Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, collusion, cheating in exams, and fabricating data. These are the ultimate sins in academia, and they are taken very seriously by the University. If they are detected and proven, the punishments can be serious. This is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of what we do.\nThe University has very strict regulations about academic dishonesty. It is your responsibility to know what counts as academic dishonesty according to the University regulations, and to make sure you avoid committing any action which could be construed as dishonest.\nThe University provides clear guidelines, and you should look at these carefully. The guidance on examination offences is here:\nhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/exams/exam-rules-and-regulations/examination-offences\nPlagiarism is probably the offence we encounter most frequently. Essentially, plagiarism is about taking credit for other people’s work. It does not have to be intentional; it is up to you to make sure you acknowledge the contributions of others.\nYou should familiarise yourself with the University’s guidance on plagiarism, which you can find here:\nhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations/plagiarism\nInformation on the consequences of academic dishonesty is included here:\nhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/7/7518/Examination_and_Academic_Offences_procedures_.pdf\n\nPreventing academic dishonesty\nEveryone involved in higher education is responsible for preventing the incidence of academic dishonesty. Prime responsibility rests with students themselves. You can help reduce the incidence of academic dishonesty through following these points of principle:\n· Be organised in your work. Students committing academic dishonesty often claim that time pressures and last minute panic led them to cheat. Such panic might be a reason for cheating but it does not excuse it. You can reduce the likelihood of such pressures by being organised, knowing what assessment deadlines you have to meet, and planning your work accordingly. If you are not a good organiser, take advice. Advice is available from your personal tutor, from study skills courses run by the University and from your network of friends and colleagues.\n• Know the rules. It is tremendously important to know what counts as academic dishonesty. One problem is of course that there is no hard and fast cut off between honesty and dishonesty; there are gradations between best practice and utterly dishonest practice. It is essential that you get a sense of where the boundary lies on this gradation. Sometimes students plead that ignorance of the rules led them to cheat. Again this ignorance may be a reason for cheating, but it does not excuse it.\n• Don’t ignore dishonest practice. There are occasions where you suspect a fellow student of committing academic dishonesty. The most common form of this practice occurs where another student uses or copies your work without your permission. If you suspect that someone is cheating in this way, then you can talk to your personal tutor, the relevant marker, the relevant module leader, or programme leader all in confidence. If your suspicion is well founded then the member of staff will take steps to detect the cheating without involving you directly.\n• Be aware of detection systems. The School of Psychology has systems for checking work submitted for assessments and detecting academic dishonesty. The marker is obviously in a good position to detect cheating such as plagiarism. Coursework submitted via the DLE is entered into plagiarism detection software which compares the content of each assignment with those of other students and with text on web sites and in journals and books. By being able to match the content of the essay with these different sources, this software now has a very high detection rate for plagiarism."

You should also discuss these circumstances with your personal tutor.\n\nAttendance monitoring\nAttendance at scheduled sessions is monitored via the use of check-in codes that are provided by the member of staff leading the session. Students should enter these via the University app to record their attendance. Although there are no check-in codes for ad-hoc sessions (e.g. meetings with your tutor or dissertation supervisor), staff enter attendance data for these meetings into the same system so that we maintain an overall picture of your engagement.\n\n\nInternational students\nIf you are an international student, please be aware that lack of attendance may lead to exclusion or failure to obtain the qualification that you are seeking.\nThe University records information about student engagement and attendance. We expect students to engage honestly with this, and may take disciplinary action against any student who attempts to bypass systems or provide false information regarding engagement and attendance.\nInformation recorded about an individual student’s engagement and attendance will only be acted on at their Faculty’s discretion and as per academic regulations, unless there is a concern for the student’s health or wellbeing, or the student holds a Tier 4 visa.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The following summarises the main criteria for awarding and classifying degrees. It is a guide only. The full regulations for the award of degrees and intermediate awards can be found in the Student Handbook.\nTo be awarded an honours degree you should have passed 360 credits of which at least 120 are at level 6 (studied in Stage 3 or 4) and a further 120 at level 5 (Stage 2). For BSc Psychology (and combined honours programmes) all modules are 20 credits except the final year project module, PSYC605 (40 credits).\nFor the classification of a degree, Stage 4 is weighted more highly than Stage 2, which in turn is weighted more highly than Stage 1. For the BSc, Stage 4 is weighted at 0.6 (60%), Stage 2 is weighted at 0.3 (30%), and Stage 1 is weighted at 0.1 (10%, calculated from the best 80 credits).\nAt each stage of the degree, your modules give you an average percentage for that stage. Your overall percentage is calculated as:\n(0.6 x Stage 4 average) + (0.3 x Stage 2 average) + (0.1 x Stage 1 average, best 80 credits only)\nYour degree classification is based on the overall mark you have achieved, using this method.\nTo determine your degree classification, your overall mark is rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. The precise boundaries are therefore as follows:\n69.5% plus: 1st class award\n59.5 to 69.49%: 2i class award\n49.5 to 59.49%: 2ii class award\n39.5 to 49.49%: 3rd class award\nHowever, there are alternative classification methods which are used if you fall just below the criteria in terms of percentage. The cut off for consideration is a percentage within 3% of the award boundary (e.g. 47%, 57% or 67%). If this is the case then we may award the higher class of degree according to either of the following two methods. These methods can only result in the award of a higher degree class (never lower), so they can only work in your favour.\n\n1. Stage 4 average\nIf your Stage-4 average is within the higher award range you can be awarded this higher class of degree. For example, if your overall average is 58% but your Stage-4 average is 61%, you can be awarded a 2i class degree.\n\n\n2. Overall profile\nWe may award a higher classification based on overall profile. This means that students who usually achieve module marks in the higher class may be awarded that class of degree, even if their overall average is below the threshold. This is rare, but sometimes applies to a student who has a small number of credits with much lower marks that drag down their overall average.\nThe calculation is somewhat complicated, but the principle is that we look at how many credits fall into each degree class across Stage 2 and Stage 4. We weight Stage 4 twice as much, by effectively doubling the number of Stage 4 credits in the higher class. We then look to see whether the majority of credits are in the higher class (or better), and award the higher degree if they are.\nFor example, consider the following example profile for a student with an overall average between 57% and 59.49%:\nStage 2: 40 credits below 2i, 80 credits at 2i or higher\nStage 4: 60 credits below 2i, 60 credits at 2i or higher\nThis student has the majority of their credits at 2i or higher, so we could award that higher degree class.\nAlso consider the following case for a student with the same average:\nStage 2: 80 credits below 2i, 40 credits at 2i or higher\nStage 4: 40 credits below 2i, 80 credits at 2i or higher\nThis student has exactly half their credits at 2i or higher based on a simple count, but because we weight Stage 4 more heavily we could award the higher degree class. Note that if we swapped the Stage 2 and 4 profiles then we would not award the higher degree."

The time limit for in-person exams is usually 2 hours. Details about the exam structure for each module will be provided on the module DLE page and the module outline. For further information about particular exams you should contact the relevant module leader who will be able to advise you.\nBecause the questions are unseen, and there is a limited time in which to answer the questions, exams are notorious for producing stress and anxiety. However you can minimise this stress by planning for exams. You can do this by:\n· Familiarising yourself with practice exam questions, including those set as coursework\n· Knowing the whole curriculum on which the exam will be based\n· Planning your time in an examination\n· Practising writing examination answers under exam conditions\n· Starting revision in good time\nGeneral criteria for marking written work are provided in this handbook. These apply to longer exam answers as well as coursework. For shorter exam answers, the marking criteria should be obvious. For example, if you are asked a simple question with one mark allocated for the answer, you will be awarded the mark if you answer correctly.\nYou can also get help on developing your examination technique through the University’s Learning Development service (www.plymouth.ac.uk/learn) who run short courses designed to help students to gain more confidence with their academic techniques.\n\nExam FAQs\nBelow is a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about exams.\nQ: Will material taught in Semester 1 appear in the exams in Semester 2?\nA: No. Modules run only in one semester. Each module is examined in the examination weeks within the semester in which it was taught.\nQ: How many questions will there be in the exam paper, and how much choice of question will I have?\nA: This will vary by module, and each module can use a range of question types. Module leaders will provide guidance about their exams.\nQ: Will there be a question about ‘topic x’ in the exam? A: We do not give you this information because it encourages ‘question-spotting’. Please do not approach staff with questions that seek to elicit information about exams that could lead to question-spotting.\nQ: What material do I have to learn to pass the exam?\nA: An exam can contain questions on material covered in lectures, provided in handouts, or covered in required reading or Psylab.\nQ: Should I include citations in an exam answer?\nA: Yes, if you can and it’s appropriate. As with written coursework, you should aim to use citations to support your argument. However, don’t leave something out just because you can’t remember the citation. Markers know that you are bound to forget some details, and using the correct citation is less important than the content of what you write.\nQ: I failed exam X, or coursework Y, by Z%. Will I fail my module or even stage?\nA: Your personal tutor can give you advice on the interpretation of the current exam regulations and the options in the event of failure or other outcomes. However, your tutor cannot tell you if you have passed or failed examinations, or if you will be able to progress to the next stage of your degree. These decisions are taken by the Award Assessment Board which meets to make decisions on degree awards and progression in June of each academic year. The decision of the Board and the options available to you will be communicated to you by letter. You can then seek further advice on the best course of action by approaching your personal tutor.\nQ: How long does my exam last?\nA: Exams normally last two hours. Confirmed information is included on the examination timetable published by the University.\nQ: When and where does my exam take place?\nA: This information is included on the examination timetable published by the University.\nQ: I have applied for and received valid extenuating circumstances for the period of the exams. Should I attempt to take the exams or just miss them?\nA: Extenuating circumstances will only cover you for missing an exam. If you decide to sit an exam, the mark will stand even if you do not do as well as you know you could. However, students should be be aware that if you fail more than 60 credits then you would normally have to repeat the failed modules in the following year rather than being able to take referred exams in August. This applies even if you have valid extenuating circumstances for missing assessments.\nQ: I missed a lecture. Where do I get the information I missed?\nA: Staff always put resources and other information related to their teaching on the relevant DLE page for the module. This material can include: the module outline, a list of lectures, handouts, learning support materials, readings and notes for the session(s). You may also be able to watch the lecture using Panopto, our lecture capture system. However, we cannot guarantee that all lectures will be available on Panopto (e.g. in the case of a technical fault).\nQ: How much does the exam/coursework contribute to the module mark?\nA: This information should be included in the module outline. It will also be provided on the course DLE page.\nQ: Where do I get a module outline?\nA: The outline for every module is on the DLE.\nQ: Where do I get help in writing examination essays?\nA: Talk to your personal tutor. Also you can get information from the Learning Development Service who offer a range of Study Guides."

We call these ‘extenuating circumstances’, and the University has procedures for ensuring that you are not disadvantaged.\nExtenuating circumstances are not simply any circumstances that affect your ability to complete an assessment. They will only be deemed valid if they are exceptional, outside your control, and occurred during or shortly before the assessment.\nThe University’s procedures are outlined here, along with examples of valid extenuating circumstances:\nhttps://liveplymouthac.sharepoint.com/sites/x70/SitePages/Extenuating-circumstances.aspx\nThe application form for extenuating circumstances is available at the above page, together with a detailed policy document.\n\nLong-term health conditions\nLong term health conditions can be described as conditions which:\n\nare persistent, typically lasting for more than three months and often life-long\ncannot be resolved in a short time, or which will recur regardless of action, or which need to be managed on a long-term basis\nare a long-term or permanent illness that often results in some type of disability and which may require you to seek help with various activities\ncan be managed but can ‘flare-up’\n\nExamples of conditions which fall into this category are: Cystic Fibrosis, Costochondritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), Psychosis, and Bipolar Disorder.\nIf you have a long-term health condition, you should discuss any support needs with Disability Services (or equivalent in partner institutions) before or soon after commencing your programme of study. It is hoped that the condition can be managed and / or you can be supported sufficiently by Disability Services (or its equivalent in partner institutions).\nhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/services/learning-gateway/disability-and-dyslexia\nHowever, there may be times when unexpected difficulties or flare-ups arise. On these occasions you are required to claim extenuating circumstances affecting specific assessments. However, you may wish to obtain a long-term ill health declaration that means you do not have to submit evidence for each extenuating circumstances claim.\nTo do this, you must complete a form that is available from the Faculty Office (or equivalent for partner institutions). This form must be accompanied by a statement from your GP, hospital consultant or appropriate specialist responsible for your treatment which provides clear confirmation of the nature, severity, duration and effect of your condition on your studies. You should submit the form to the Faculty Office for consideration.\nOnce a claim is authorised, you will continue to be required to submit an extenuating circumstances claim for any missed assignment submission deadline, test, or examination which is directly attributable to a flare-up of your long-term health condition, but you will not be required to resubmit evidence.\nAs a result of this process, we may need to invoke the Fitness to Study process to consider your case in more detail.\nYou must inform your Faculty or partner institution of any change in your condition, whether improvement or deterioration, in order that the claim can be reassessed. The Faculty or partner institution may require further evidence from time to time. You will be contacted at the start of each academic year to review your case.\n\n\nStudy and Wellbeing Policy\nThe University is committed to an ethos of equality and inclusivity, and aims to facilitate and promote positive health and wellbeing through the recognition and understanding of all relevant health conditions and disabilities. Occasionally a student’s circumstances or health may impact upon their own, or others’ ability to fulfil that potential. Levels of risk will be assessed by the University on a case-by case basis in conjunction with appropriate professionals.\nThe Study and Wellbeing Policy and the accompanying procedures are to be followed by University of Plymouth staff where significant concerns have arisen as a result of a student’s extended absence, health condition, wellbeing or other circumstances that lead to an inability to progress in their programme, or that adversely affect others. The key purpose of the policy is to ensure that the best interests of the student are met and to provide appropriate guidance and support.

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are occasions when at the end of the year students may have failed one or more of their modules. Failure can occur because of non-attendance at exams, late or non-submission of coursework, or poor performance in the required assessments for a module.\nA module can also be failed due to failing a pass/fail requirement even though the coursework and/or exams have been satisfactorily completed.\nStudents may have extenuating circumstances for particular assessments which have been deemed valid and which account either completely or in part for the failure.\nStudents will be officially informed which modules they have failed through their end of year transcript. The award assessment board can make a number of decisions in relation to such failures. The Board has ultimate discretion in its decisions so the following points are provided as guidance only.\n• If a student has failed modules totalling up to 60 credits (e.g. 3 x 20 credit modules), then they would normally be required to resit the relevant assessments prior to the start of the next academic year before they will be allowed to progress to the next stage or be awarded a degree. The overall mark in the module in which the student is ‘referred’ will be capped at 40%. This mark will be carried forward and used to determine the overall mark for that stage of the degree. Students are allowed a maximum of two attempts at passing a module.\n• If a student has failed more than 60 credits then they would normally be required to repeat the failed modules in the following academic year. Again, the overall mark in the module in which the student is referred will be capped at 40%. Students are allowed a maximum of two attempts at passing a module.\n• The Board can also decide whether a resit or a repeat is as a first or second attempt. If a resit is a second attempt then the overall module mark is capped at 40%. However, where the board has decided that a resit is a first attempt then the student will resit the assessment as if for the first time, and the mark obtained will not be capped at 40%. The decision to allow a resit as a first attempt normally only occurs where a student has valid extenuating circumstances relating to the particular assessment. It is important to note that valid extenuating circumstances never alter marks. Extenuating circumstances only allow the student to resit or repeat the assessment as the same attempt. In the case of coursework, students with valid extenuating circumstances may be allowed to submit the assessment after the deadline but within a specified period. Students with valid extenuating circumstances will be informed via email of the decision relating to their assessments by the Faculty Extenuating Circumstances Committee."

    "text": "One of the most common complaints made to members of staff by students concerns noise and other disturbances in lectures or other taught sessions. This noise mostly arises from students talking persistently during the lecture or using their phones. Talking, texting, listening to music through headphones, packing up before the lecture has finished, and so on are all distracting to fellow students and staff alike.\nThese activities are not only inconsiderate and rude, they place fellow students in a position where they are unable to engage fully with the content. This is especially the case for those students who have a hearing impairment or other special educational need. In the case of such students, the University has statutory obligations under the Equality Act 2010 to take reasonable steps to ensure that the learning environment is appropriate for disabled students.\nWhile a lecture is in progress it is essential that people remain quiet and attentive. Please do not talk to others during the lecture in a way that is likely to be disruptive. It’s also important that you don’t use phones and laptops in a way that distracts others.\nPlease also note that you should not leave the lecture room until the lecturer has signalled the end of the lecture. If you arrive late to a lecture, please enter by the back and take a seat as quietly as possible.\nThese are all obvious rules to follow. The University considers disruption of lectures to be a disciplinary offence. To that end, lecturers can ask anyone seen disrupting lectures to leave. If the problem persists then the School will take steps to identify individual offenders and initiate disciplinary proceedings against them."

    "text": "The University expects all students to participate fully in the learning opportunities offered by their programme of study and encourages all students to take advantage of additional opportunities for development, both personally and academically. As part of this, attendance at lectures is an expectation. We also believe that note-taking is itself a valuable skill, and research suggests that it enhances retention of information.\nHowever, we also recognise that it can be useful to review lectures later. For this reason, lectures are recorded using a lecture capture system called Panopto. This records audio, video, and slides. Links to view lectures will appear on the relevant module page of the DLE, usually within 24 hours of the lecture taking place.\n\nPersonal recordings\nThere are occasions when Panopto fails to record a lecture, although these are rare. If it is critical for you that you have a recording, then you can make your own recording of a lecture. However, you must seek the permission of the lecturer before the lecture begins. Lectures and learning materials are the intellectual property of the University and the staff who develop them. Any recording that is made with the lecturer’s permission must not be distributed in any format (including through posting the recording or a transcription on the internet e.g. Facebook, YouTube etc.). The information may only be used in support of your own learning or other students registered on the programme. Unauthorised sharing of lectures may be dealt with under the Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Procedure for students.\nThe University recognises that recording can form a reasonable adjustment for students with disabilities. If you wish to record lectures or other learning opportunities in order to make the information more accessible to you due to a disability, please contact Disability Services for advice on ways the University can support you. If Disability Services have notified your school that recording lectures will support your learning, you will not need to seek the permission of the lecturer before the lecture begins, but recordings must not be distributed in any format."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Awarding marks to written coursework, exam answers, and other assignments at degree level seldom involves the mechanistic application of fixed marking criteria. In recognition of this, markers will seek evidence for the presence of a number of strengths and weaknesses. Our generic marking criteria are here.\nThis table contains example strengths and weaknesses corresponding to different classes and grades of mark. These examples are not an exhaustive list of the very many things considered in marking a complex piece of written work. They are included here as a general guide to what typically distinguishes strong from weaker work.\nFor coursework, you will be given marking criteria for each assignment. These will usually be included as part of the coursework template that you will use to prepare your submission. They may be the same as the generic criteria, or they may include additional criteria that address other aspects of the assignment.\nIn applying marking criteria to specific pieces of work, markers will first assess whether the strengths and weaknesses associated with a particular degree class are present in the answer, and to what degree. To qualify for a given degree class, an answer should display all or most of the strengths for that class and lower classes. It may also be subject to one or two of the weaknesses associated with that class, but should largely be free of the more serious weaknesses associated with lower classes.\nMarkers may decide that certain strengths are sufficient to compensate for specific weaknesses, and select a degree class accordingly. For example, an essay which answers the question, is generally accurate, well-informed, and well-organised, but which contains some inaccuracies, omissions, and flaws in the argument, may still merit an upper-second class mark.\nAdditionally, markers may decide that specific strengths are present to such a degree that they compensate for the absence of one or a few other strengths associated with a particular degree class. For example, a highly original, insightful and well-argued examination answer may merit the award of a first class mark even though it contains some omissions or minor inaccuracies.\nEqually, specific weaknesses may be present that are judged so serious that strengths associated with a higher degree class are insufficient to provide compensation. For example, a reasonably comprehensive, well-organised and well-presented essay may merit a lower-second class mark - or even a third-class mark - if certain concepts or facts essential for an adequate answer to the question are misunderstood or omitted.\nMarkers will also take account of the time students have available to answer questions in an exam, and will expect evidence for a greater depth of analysis and a more extensive knowledge base for longer written assignments and examination answers, than for shorter examination answers and written assignments.\nIt is important to note that marking a complex piece of work, such as an essay, is a holistic process, taking into account very many specific elements, but most importantly the degree to which a piece of work succeeds as a whole. It is the overall impression of the marker that is reflected in the final grade."

More information on this is provided in the section describing how degrees are awarded.\nAs a guide, a pass mark is anything above 40%. Marks from 40% to 49% correspond to a third class degree, marks from 50% to 59% correspond to a 2:2, and marks from 60% to 69% correspond to a 2:1. Marks of 70% or higher are equivalent to a first class standard of work.\nThe mark you receive will usually be a percentage score. Where work is marked using categorical grades (e.g. A-, C+) these will be converted into percentages using a standard table, provided here.\n\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n100\n\n\nA\n88\n\n\nA-\n77\n\n\nB+\n68\n\n\nB\n65\n\n\nB-\n62\n\n\nC+\n58\n\n\nC\n55\n\n\nC-\n52\n\n\nD+\n48\n\n\nD\n45\n\n\nD-\n42\n\n\nF+\n38\n\n\nF\n25\n\n\nF-\n15\n\n\nN\n0\n\n\n\nAn assignment or exam might consist of more than one piece of work marked in this way, in which case your mark will be an aggregate of the separate grades in the proportions specified in the module outline.\nNote that the first class grades (A+, A, A-) are spaced further apart on the percentage scale than grades in the lower classes. This is designed to recognise the achievements of students who submit at least some first class work, by effectively giving first class marks more weighting when marks are aggregated together.\n\nReceiving your mark\nIf you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected provided we are made aware of the problem.\nIf you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader or the person who set the work to discuss it (e.g. during their office hours). It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately.\nYou should always keep a copy of the coursework which you have submitted. Once you have had your work returned you should also keep the returned work and the feedback sheet with the grade awarded. Evidence of the original mark awarded to you is important if the Faculty needs to correct or add missing marks to your overall mark profile.\nYou should note that all marks you receive on returned coursework are provisional until agreed by the Subject Assessment Panel in June. Although it is unlikely, it is possible for the marks which you have received for a piece of work to be changed by this panel. Your end of year transcript will show your final agreed marks for each module which you have taken."

It is possible for students studying one of our BSc programmes to transfer to an MPsych, and details are provided on this page.\nThe MPsych is still an undergraduate degree, and not the same as an MSc degree, but it prepares you for a more advanced and specialised career in psychology.\nStudents enrolled on an MPsych take exactly the same Stage 1, 2 and 4 modules (including final year project) as those enrolled on BSc Psychology. However, instead of graduating after Stage 4, MPsych students take the extra Stage 5 year with the Master’s level modules, and graduate the following year with an MPsych degree (instead of a BSc degree). Stage 5 consists of 120 credits, including a 40 or 60 credit research project.\nOur MPsych programmes are accredited with the BPS, and students enrolled on an MPsych degree should be able to obtain student loans for tuition fees for the whole 4 years (or 5 years including a placement year).\nAn alternative route is to graduate with the BSc and then take a traditional MSc course. We currently offer three MSc programmes that correspond roughly to the three MPsych programmes: MSc Research Methods in Psychology, MSc Clinical Psychology, and MSc Human Neuroscience. Students taking an MSc will normally already have a BSc, and will take 180 credits (again including a 40 or 60 credit research project). Because it requires more credits, studying for the MSc is more intensive than the MPsych, but the content covered in both MPsych and MSc is otherwise equivalent.\nIt is possible to transfer or change enrolment to the MPsych from the BSc degree, as follows:\n\nTransfer from Stage 1 of BSc\nStudents who have just started the BSc degree have a limited opportunity from induction week up to the end of the first week of teaching in Semester 1 to change enrolment to the MPsych Stage 1. The requirements are ABB or equivalent at A-level. Please contact Karen Barnett for more details of Stage 1 transfers.\n\n\nTransfer from Stage 2 or 4 of BSc\nStage 2 and 4 students can request to transfer to MPsych provided they have attained a minimum average grade of 50% at the end of the academic year. The request to transfer can be made any time before the end of the year. Transfers will be provisional until the exam board is held in June, at which point grades are confirmed and the transfer finalised.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As part of the requirements for PSYC424 and PSYC513, you are asked to gain some experience of psychological research through participation in approved studies carried out by project students, research staff, and lecturers. This like a social contract - you are asked to earn points in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and you are later given points to recruit participants when you come to do your dissertation in Stage 4.\nParticipation is recorded in the form of participation points. You get one point for taking part in a study lasting up to 30 minutes, two points for one lasting up to 1 hour and so on. You will need to collect 22 points by the deadline at the end of the academic year (provided in the deadlines document, on the programme DLE page).\nGetting the required number of points is part of the module assessment and so if you do not get the required number of points (or pass the alternative essay requirement – see below) you will be deemed to have failed the module.\nYou are advised to start collecting points as early as possible and aim to get at least 10 in the first semester. If there is a genuine shortfall in the number of points available then the School may make alternative arrangements to allow you to complete the module satisfactorily.\nThe School uses an electronic sign-up system for experimental participation. This means that you can select studies and sign up for them on-line. Each experiment will have details of the nature of the experiment, who is conducting it (it could be staff or students), where it is to be held and at what time. You will be sent a reminder electronically shortly before you are due to take part in the study. You should turn up and then participate in the study at the indicated time and place.\nIf you change your mind about participating, or the experimenter wishes to cancel your appointment, then this is allowed provided that you do so before 16:00 the day before (weekends excluded, so you must cancel a Monday appointment by 4 pm on Friday). If you give less notice, or do not turn up, twice the number of points that you would have got from the study will be deducted from your existing total. If the experimenter fails to turn up, or cancels with less than the required notice, then you are entitled to your points anyway. The electronic system should be able to cope with this, but if there are problems you should contact the points administrator: sonaadmin.psy@plymouth.ac.uk\nIf you miss three (not necessarily consecutive) experiments without giving the required notice or with valid extenuating circumstances, you will be locked out of system and must talk to your tutor to explain the situation. The tutor may then email the administrator to reactivate their account. If you then miss three more (i.e. six in total), you will be locked out permanently and must do the alternative essay (see below) instead.\nFurther details of the electronic system will be given to you at the start of the academic year, and you should also refer to the “Points Manager Participant Guide” available online at https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk.\nThe system keeps a record of all experiments in which you have participated and points awarded. This will be automatically used to assess your pass/fail status. If you find any discrepancies in your record which you can see in the system then contact sonaadmin.psy@plymouth.ac.uk\nDetails of which studies you participated in are carried forward to allow researchers to recruit participants who have not already done the experiment.\nParticipating in studies is not compulsory, though it is strongly advised as a valuable experience where you can learn more about the kind of research psychologists carry out. The School considers that experience of being a participant in research is almost essential to running one’s own research on others, and to evaluating the psychological research literature. However, if you are unable or unwilling to act as a participant then there is an alternative way to pass PSYC424 and PSYC513: you can write an extended essay on a topic that will be provided at the start of the module. The deadline for submission of the essay will be stated on the DLE page for the module. Also remember that if you fail to collect enough participation points or do not complete the alternative essay on time, then you will fail the module."

If the module has more than one assessment, you do not need to pass every one in order to pass the module – provided your overall module mark is 40% or above. For instance, PSYC601 has an essay worth 50% of the module and an exam worth 50%. A student who got a zero for the essay and 88% for the exam would still pass the module, since their overall module mark would be (0 x .5 + 88 x .5) = 44. Obviously it is easier to get good module marks if you do well in each assessment!\nThe module outline for each module will tell you what the assessments are, and how the marks are combined to give the module mark.\nAdditionally, some modules have a pass/fail requirement in addition to coursework (e.g. research participation for PSYC424 and PSYC513, Psylab tasks for some Stage 2 and 4 modules, research ethics for PSYC605). Where a pass/fail requirement is part of a module’s assessment package, you need to satisfy this requirement to pass the module, as well as gaining an overall mark of 40% in the other assessments. If you do not complete the pass/fail assessment then you will fail the module even if your mark for the graded components is over 40%.\nA full explanation of the University regulations concerning successful completion of modules is available here:\nhttps://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations"

Some people have argued that phones should be banned from teaching spaces altogether because they are distracting. Studies suggest that using technology for off-task purposes during lectures can have a negative impact on learning (e.g. here and here). There is also evidence that your use of technology can harm the learning of other students sitting nearby (here). However, many others believe that students should have the freedom to use their devices as they see fit.\nOur position is that personal technology is an essential part of university life, but that we should think carefully about how we use it to support learning, engagement, and community. You will use computers to access teaching materials, analyse data, complete coursework, and so on. Many of you will also use computers to take notes during lectures, so the exclusion of technology from our teaching spaces wouldn’t be practical. We also believe that learning to work with technology present is a core skill that all of us need to develop. However, we ask that you consider carefully how you can reduce the tendency of your devices to distract you and others.\nAlthough you will use a laptop for learning, you will rarely need your phone in lectures or workshops. We appreciate that there will always be times when some students need to be able to receive messages about things going on outside lectures, but whenever possible your phone should be out of sight and switched off. You should also make sure that you use your laptops for work purposes only during teaching sessions. Browsing the internet or watching videos during lectures is distracting for the people sitting around you, and is not consistent with our aim of creating an effective and supportive learning environment."

This means that you must complete a certain number of tasks to pass the module. Psylab does not contribute directly to your module mark, which is determined by other assessments. However, if you do not complete enough Psylab tasks then you will fail the module and your module mark may therefore be capped if you pass at a later date. We do not expect students who are engaged with the course to fail the Psylab element of any module.\nEach task has a closing date associated with it. In order to mark an activity as completed, you need to finish it before the closing date. This should not be onerous – you will have a maximum of one activity per module per week, and most can be completed in less than an hour.\nOn the final day of each module (before the exam period), we will count the number of activities you have completed.

Extensive paraphrasing of someone else’s work, whether another student’s or a published author’s, is unlikely to pass.\n\nReferencing guidelines\nWhen psychologists write articles, reports or book chapters, they use a very specific set of conventions to reference the work of other people. This set of conventions is called the APA (American Psychological Association) style. As an undergraduate you are required to use this style when you write your assessments.\nThere are two things that you need to do. The first is to use in-text citations when you write about somebody else’s ideas or findings. The second is to include a references section at the end of your work that gives a detailed reference for each in-text citation. In essence, the in-text citation tells the reader whose work it was, and the reference list tells us where to find that work.\nThe formatting of references may seem a little picky at first. However, there are very sound reasons for the rules which the APA has devised. Essentially, the rules are designed to enable the reader to find the original reference easily. You should follow these rules in all work which you submit for psychology modules.

These topics will be described at the start of each module, so you don’t need to make any choices beforehand.\n\nSemester 1\nPSYC601: Current Topics in Psychology 1*\nPSYC602: Current Topics in Psychology 2\n\n\nSemester 2\nPSYC603: Current Topics in Psychology 3*\nPSYC604: Current Topics in Psychology 4\n\n\nDissertation\nPSYC605: Research Project*\nThe dissertation module is unique in our programmes in two ways. Firstly, it is taken across both semesters. Secondly, it is worth 40 credits instead of 20. This means that your mark in this module has twice as much weighting in your final degree calculation as each of your other Stage 4 modules."

    "text": "This section applies ONLY to Psychology modules. If you are taking modules in other schools then you need to check their submission procedures carefully.\nMuch of your coursework will be submitted online, using the DLE. For each piece of coursework there is a deadline. It is very important that work is submitted on or before the deadline.\nThere is a specific procedure which you must follow when submitting work. If this procedure is not followed then the work may not be credited as having been submitted. When you submit your work, you are responsible for ensuring that it has been received and logged correctly.\n\nLate submissions\nEach deadline will have a specific time, clearly stated. You are strongly advised to submit your work well before this time as a submission even one second after the deadline is automatically deemed late by the coursework submission system. For example, if the deadline is listed as midday then you must submit your work by 12:00:00, i.e. the second after 11:59:59. If you submit at 12:00:01, even though your clock may say the time is 12:00, this will count as a late submission.\nCoursework will be accepted if the deadline for that piece of work has passed. However, the work will be deemed late and will receive a maximum mark of 40% if submitted no later than 24 hours after the deadline, or 0% if submitted later than that. Nevertheless, the work will be handed back with feedback.\nThere may be occasions where you believe that there were good reasons for failing to submit coursework by the deadline. Circumstances that give rise to such occasions and that can be backed up with corroborating evidence are known as extenuating circumstances. There is a specific procedure for applying for extenuating circumstances which must be followed if you want them taken into account (see section on extenuating circumstances later in this guide).\nPlease note that no member of staff in the School of Psychology can give you an extension for a piece of coursework - you must follow the procedure for extenuating circumstances outlined later in this guide.\n\n\nPreparing your submission\nFor each piece of coursework, you will be provided with a template. This template will have the correct line spacing, font, font size, margins etc. already set up for you. It’s important that you don’t change these settings, because they ensure two things. Firstly, they ensure that we have the space to write feedback on your work. Secondly, they ensure that each page of text, even if submitted by different students, contains a comparable number of words. This in turn allows us to give meaningful guidance on the length of each assignment.\nEnsure that you complete all of the information on the cover sheet on the first page of this template. You should ensure that you enter your student registration number (SRN) in the header.\nOn each module’s DLE page you will find a link through which you can submit coursework for that module. All coursework must be submitted as a single portable document format (PDF) file unless instructed otherwise.\nThere is a penalty for submitting in a different format, typically one grade. For example, if the marker thought an essay was worth a ‘B’, but the student had submitted in .docx rather than .pdf format, the essay would be awarded a B-. This penalty reflects the additional workload created by work submitted in the wrong format.\nWhen preparing your work for submission you should name the PDF you wish to submit in according with the following scheme:\nModuleCode_SRN_AssignmentName.pdf\nFor example:\nPSYC421_12345678_Practical.pdf\nwould be student 12345678’s practical report for PSYC421.\n\n\nHow to submit coursework\nTo submit your work, follow the link for that assignment. You will need to check the declaration box to confirm that the work is your own. To upload your PDF document drag the file into the box that contains the text “You can drag and drop files here to add them”. As your work uploads you will see a progress bar that may take a few moments to complete. When the upload is complete the progress bar will be replaced by a file icon. You can then click on the “Save Changes” button to submit your work. Clicking on “Save Changes” whilst the progress bar is still present may result in your work not being submitted correctly. Upon successful submission you will receive a receipt via email.\nWork may be submitted as many times before the deadline as you wish to enable you to improve your work. If you feel you need to work on a piece of coursework right up until the final deadline you should make use of this facility by uploading an earlier version of your work well before the deadline. You can always replace this earlier version an unlimited number of times up until the deadline. However, if you attempt to resubmit work after the deadline it will be marked as late."

    "text": "Students who wish to withdraw from their programme should consult their personal tutor for advice. If this is not possible then the Senior Tutor or Programme Leader are available as backups.\nDiscussing issues that affect your studies may lead to a resolution without recourse to withdrawal. An alternative to withdrawal from the programme is the option to suspend studies for a period (e.g. one academic year). This is sometimes a good option for students who need to deal with things that may otherwise hinder their studies.\nStudents thinking of suspending should first talk to their personal tutor to understand the process. The tutor can liaise with the Faculty office to clarify the steps required.\nStudents should be aware that there are deadlines for the full or partial refund of tuition fees.\nMore information is available here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is a lot more to being a full-time student than will appear on your timetable. On average, only a third of your week will be spent attending scheduled teaching sessions. You will spend the remainder reading textbooks and research papers, working with other students, working on assignments, and preparing for workshops and other meetings.\nNot every session will appear on your timetable. For instance, you will be required to meet with your personal tutor. We will give you clear information about any non-timetabled sessions that you need to attend, normally by emailing you using your university address.\nOfficially, a 20-credit module is designed to require 200 hours of work, divided between formal teaching, independent study, and assessment. The modules you take each year therefore require 1200 hours of effort in total, which results in an average of 40 hours per week across the two semesters. You should take this workload into account when planning part-time work during term-time; undertaking a degree means that you are in full-time education."
